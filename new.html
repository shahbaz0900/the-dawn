  <div> <h2>South Korean spy agency says North Korea hackers tried stealing Pfizer vaccine know-how</h2>
   
   <p>North Korea has attempted to steal Covid-19 vaccine technology by hacking Pfizer Inc according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), Yonhap news agency reported.

       South Korea's Yonhap did not report when the alleged hacking took place or whether it was successful, Reuters said.
       
       Last year suspected North Korean hackers tried to break into at least nine health organisations, including Johnson & Johnson , Novavax Inc, and AstraZeneca.
       
       South Korea's intelligence agency said it had foiled North Korean attempts to hack into South Korean companies developing coronavirus vaccines.

               <h2>Kazakhstan to roll out first locally produced Sputnik vaccine</h2>
               <p>Kazakhstan will be the first country in the world to locally produce Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, after a pharmaceutical company received government authorisation to make the jab, the company said.

                   The company, called the Karaganda Pharmaceutical Complex (KPC), “was granted certification” to produce the vaccine by Kazakhstan's health ministry on Monday, KPC said in a statement on the Telegram messenger service.
                   
                   A spokesman for the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which financed the development of the two-dose jab, told AFP that Kazakhstan is the first country to begin local production of Sputnik V.
                   
                   He said Brazil, India and South Korea are expected to follow.</p> <hr/>

                           Veteran diplomat Allan Wagner, 79, was sworn in less than 24 hours after Elizabeth Astete became the second top official to step down over the scandal, Reuters reported.
                           
                           Peru has been gripped in recent days by the news that government officials received the Covid-19 vaccination weeks or even months before the South American country launched its immunisation programme.
                           
                           Health minister Pilar Mazzetti stepped down last week following a newspaper report that former president Martin Vizcarra had received a shot of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in October. Peru only began its immunisation drive, starting with healthcare workers, in early February after receiving 300,000 doses of vaccine.</p> <hr/>
